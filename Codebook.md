This code book summarizes the resulting data fields in tidy.txt.


The intermediate variables and data sets that were created while writing the script - 
trainx, trainy, trainsub, testx, testy, testsub - These data sets were created when the training and test data sets were read into R
x - a dataset that rbinds trainx and testx
y - a dataset that rbinds trainy and testy
sub- a dataset that rbinds trainsub and testsub
meas - a dataset created when the features.txt file was read into R
mean_sd - a vector that holds the indices of meas dataset that have names with the elements-mean OR sd in them
actlabels - a dataset that is created when activity_labels file was read into R
agg_data - a dataset that is created using cbind on x, y and sub
average - a tidy set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

Identifiers

subject - The ID of the test subject
activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken
