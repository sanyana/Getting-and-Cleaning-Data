# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data Course Project


A.   The R script is written based on the following instructions
          Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
          Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
          Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
          Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
          From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity             and each subject.
         The data is collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S Smartphone.  
            For each record the following info is provided - 
      - Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
      - Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
      - A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
      - Its activity label. 
      - An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
          
B.   The Codebook.md file  gives information regarding all the intermediate variables and data sets created while accomplishing the            project requirements.
